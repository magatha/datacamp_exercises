Basic CASE statements
What is your favorite team?
The European Soccer Database contains data about 12,800 matches from 11 countries played between 2011-2015! Throughout this course, you will be shown filtered versions of the tables in this database in order to better explore their contents.
In this exercise, you will identify matches played between FC Schalke 04 and FC Bayern Munich. There are 2 teams identified in each match in the hometeam_id and awayteam_id columns, available to you in the filtered matches_germany table. ID can join to the team_api_id column in the teams_germany table, but you cannot perform a join on both at the same time.
However, you can perform this operation using a CASE statement once you've identified the team_api_id associated with each team!
Please note that you can reference the slides from the video on the TOP RIGHT of your screen!

CASE statements comparing column values
Barcelona is considered one of the strongest teams in Spain's soccer league.
In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011/2012 season where Barcelona was the home team. You will do this using a CASE statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group -- wins, losses, and ties.
In 3 steps, you will build a query that identifies a match's winner, identifies the identity of the opponent, and finally filters for Barcelona as the home team. Completing a query in this order will allow you to watch your results take shape with each new piece of information.
The matches_spain table currently contains Barcelona's matches from the 2011/2012 season, and has two key columns, hometeam_id and awayteam_id, that can be joined with the teams_spain table. However, you can only join teams_spain to one column at a time.

         ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome

CASE statements comparing two column values part 2
Similar to the previous exercise, you will construct a query to determine the outcome of Barcelona's matches where they played as the away team. You will learn how to combine these two queries in chapters 2 and 3.
Did their performance differ from the matches where they were the home team?

/*
In CASE of rivalry
Barcelona and Real Madrid have been rival teams for more than 80 years. Matches between these two teams are given the name El Clásico (The Classic). In this exercise, you will query a list of matches played between these two rivals.
You will notice in Step 2 that when you have multiple logical conditions in a CASE statement, you may quickly end up with a large number of WHEN clauses to logically test every outcome you are interested in. It's important to make sure you don't accidentally exclude key information in your ELSE clause.
In this exercise, you will retrieve information about matches played between Barcelona (id = 8634) and Real Madrid (id = 8633). Note that the query you are provided with already identifies the Clásico matches using a filter in the WHERE clause.

/*
Filtering your CASE statement
Let's generate a list of matches won by Italy's Bologna team! There are quite a few additional teams in the two tables, so a key part of generating a usable query will be using your CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE clause.
CASE statements allow you to categorize data that you're interested in -- and exclude data you're not interested in. In order to do this, you can use a CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE statement to remove output you don't want to see.

Here is how you might set that up:
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE 
    CASE WHEN a > 5 THEN 'Keep'
         WHEN a <= 5 THEN 'Exclude' END = 'Keep';
         
In essence, you can use the CASE statement as a filtering column like any other column in your database. The only difference is that you don't alias the statement in WHERE.
*/

-- Select team_long_name and team_api_id from team
SELECT
	team_long_name,
	team_api_id

	season,
	date,

/*
COUNT using CASE WHEN
Do the number of soccer matches played in a given European country differ across seasons? We will use the European Soccer Database to answer this question.
You will examine the number of matches played in 3 seasons within each country listed in the database. This is much easier to explore with each season's matches in separate columns. Using the country and unfiltered match table, you will count the number of matches played in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 match seasons.

/*
COUNT and CASE WHEN with multiple conditions
In R or Python, you have the ability to calculate a SUM of logical values (i.e., TRUE/FALSE) directly. In SQL, you have to convert these values into 1 and 0 before calculating a sum. This can be done using a CASE statement.
There's one key difference when using SUM to aggregate logical values compared to using COUNT in the previous exercise --
Your goal here is to use the country and match table to determine the total number of matches won by the home team in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 seasons.

/*
Calculating percent with CASE and AVG
CASE statements will return any value you specify in your THEN clause. This is an incredibly powerful tool for robust calculations and data manipulation when used in conjunction with an aggregate statement. One key task you can perform is using CASE inside an AVG function to calculate a percentage of information in your database.

Here's an example of how you set that up:
AVG(CASE WHEN condition_is_met THEN 1
         WHEN condition_is_not_met THEN 0 END)
         
With this approach, it's important to accurately specify which records count as 0, otherwise your calculations may not be correct!
Your task is to examine the number of wins, losses, and ties in each country. The matches table is filtered to include all matches from the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons.
